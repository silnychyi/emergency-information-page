## Emergency Information Page — Generator + Viewer

Minimal **Next.js + Tailwind** static app for creating and viewing Base64-encoded **In Case of Emergency (ICE)** pages — perfect for **NFC tags** or **QR codes**.

[**Get it here**](https://silnychyi.github.io/emergency-information-page/)

## ✨ What it does

- **Generate** a compact, Base64-encoded payload from ICE details (name, contacts, medical notes, etc.)
- **View** the payload via a clean page
- **Share** as a single URL you can print as a QR or write to an NFC tag
- **No backend / no tracking** — it’s a static site
